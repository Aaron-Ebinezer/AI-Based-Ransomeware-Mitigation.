#AI-Driven Ransomware Mitigation Tool with Advanced Features

Ransomware attacks have become a prevalent threat to organizations and individuals, causing significant financial and data losses. Existing solutions rely heavily on signature-based detection and heuristic approaches, which are often ineffective against new and evolving ransomware variants. To address these limitations, this project proposes an AI-driven ransomware mitigation tool integrated with advanced features for real-time detection, proactive response, and enhanced user education.

The proposed system leverages machine learning models to identify ransomware-like behaviors, such as bulk file modifications, unauthorized encryption activities, and abnormal resource usage. Unlike traditional tools, it employs a honeypot-based detection mechanism that uses decoy files to lure ransomware, triggering instant alerts and automated responses. Furthermore, the system integrates an immutable backup solution that ensures the safety and recoverability of critical data even after a successful attack.

To enhance transparency and reliability, the project introduces a decentralized backup system using blockchain technology, ensuring that backups remain tamper-proof and verifiable. The system also incorporates threat intelligence integration through APIs to fetch the latest ransomware signatures and updates, allowing it to adapt to emerging threats in real-time. Additionally, a gamified training dashboard is provided to educate users and organizations about ransomware risks and response strategies through interactive simulations.

This tool is designed to be lightweight, affordable, and scalable, catering to the needs of small businesses, educational institutions, and individuals. By combining cutting-edge AI technology with proactive measures and user education, the proposed solution aims to set a new benchmark in ransomware mitigation, addressing gaps in existing systems while promoting cybersecurity awareness.
